# This script runs the end-to-end tests against the eventing sources
# built from source.

# If you already have the `KO_DOCKER_REPO` environment variable set and a
# cluster setup and currently selected in your kubeconfig, call the script
# with the `--run-tests` argument and it will use the cluster and run the tests.

# Calling this script without arguments will create a new cluster in
# project $PROJECT_ID, start Knative serving and the eventing system, run
# the tests and delete the cluster.
