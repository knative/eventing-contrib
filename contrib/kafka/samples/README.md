# Apache Kafka - Source

The Apache Kafka Event source enables Knative Eventing integration with Apache
Kafka. When an message is produced to Apache Kafka, the Apache Kafka Event
Source will consume the produced message and post that message the corresponding
event sink.

This sample demonstrates how to configure, deploy, and use the Apache Kafka
Event Source with a Knative Service.

## Build and Deploy Steps

### Prerequisites

1. An existing instance of Apache Kafka must be running to use the Apache Kafka
   Event Source.
   - In order to consume and produce messages, a topic must be created on the
     Apache Kafka instance.
   - A list of bootstrap servers corresponding to Apache Kafka instance must be
     obtained.
2. Install the `ko` CLI for building and deploying purposes.
   ```
   go get github.com/google/go-containerregistry/cmd/ko
   ```
3. A container registry, such as a Docker Hub account, is required.
   - Export the `KO_DOCKER_REPO` environment variable with a value denoting the
     container registry to use.
     ```
     export KO_DOCKER_REPO="docker.io/YOUR_REPO"
     ```

### Build and Deployment

The following steps build and deploy the Apache Kafka Event Controller, Source,
and an Event Display Service.

- Assuming current working directory is the project root `eventing-sources`.

#### Apache Kafka Event Controller

1. Build the Apache Kafka Event Controller and configure a Service Account,
   Cluster Role, Controller, and Source.
   ```
   $ ko apply -f contrib/kafka/config
   ...
   serviceaccount/kafka-controller-manager created
   clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/eventing-sources-kafka-controller created
   clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/eventing-sources-kafka-controller created
   customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/kafkasources.sources.eventing.knative.dev configured
   service/kafka-controller created
   statefulset.apps/kafka-controller-manager created
   ```
2. Check that the `kafka-controller-manager-0` pod is running.
   ```
   $ kubectl get pods -n knative-sources
   NAME                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   kafka-controller-manager-0   1/1       Running   0          42m
   ```
3. Check the `controller-manager-0` pod logs.
   ```
   $ kubectl logs kafka-controller-manager-0 -n knative-sources
   2019/03/19 22:25:54 Registering Components.
   2019/03/19 22:25:54 Setting up Controller.
   2019/03/19 22:25:54 Adding the Apache Kafka Source controller.
   2019/03/19 22:25:54 Starting Apache Kafka controller.
   ```

#### Apache Kafka Event Source

1. Modify `contrib/kafka/samples/event-source.yaml` accordingly with bootstrap
   servers, topics, etc...
2. Build and deploy the event source.
   ```
   $ ko apply -f contrib/kafka/samples/event-source.yaml
   ...
   kafkasource.sources.eventing.knative.dev/kafka-source created
   ```
3. Check that the event source pod is running. The pod name will be prefixed
   with `kafka-source`.
   ```
   $ kubectl get pods
   NAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   kafka-source-xlnhq-5544766765-dnl5s   1/1       Running   0          40m
   ```
4. Ensure the Apache Kafka Event Source started with the necessary
   configuration.
   ```
   $ kubectl logs kafka-source-xlnhq-5544766765-dnl5s
   {"level":"info","ts":"2019-03-19T22:31:52.689Z","caller":"receive_adapter/main.go:97","msg":"Starting Apache Kafka Receive Adapter...","adapter":{"BootstrapServers":"...","Topic":"...","ConsumerGroup":"...","Net":{"SASL":{"Enable":true,"User":"...","Password":"..."},"TLS":{"Enable":true}},"SinkURI":"http://event-display.default.svc.cluster.local/"}}
   ```

#### Event Display

1. Build and deploy the Event Display Service.
   ```
   $ ko apply -f contrib/kafka/samples/event-display.yaml
   ...
   service.serving.knative.dev/event-display created
   ```
2. Ensure that the Service pod is running. The pod name will be prefixed with
   `event-display`.
   ```
   $ kubectl get pods
   NAME                                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   event-display-00001-deployment-5d5df6c7-gv2j4   2/2       Running   0          72s
   ...
   ```

### Verify

1. Produce the message shown below to Apache Kafka.
   ```
   {"msg": "This is a test!"}
   ```
2. Check that the Apache Kafka Event Source consumed the message and sent it to
   its sink properly.
   ```
   $ kubectl logs kafka-source-xlnhq-5544766765-dnl5s
   ...
   {"level":"info","ts":1553034726.5351956,"logger":"fallback","caller":"adapter/adapter.go:121","msg":"Received: {value 15 0 {\"msg\": \"This is a test!\"} <nil>}"}
   {"level":"info","ts":1553034726.546107,"logger":"fallback","caller":"adapter/adapter.go:154","msg":"Successfully sent event to sink"}
   ```
3. Ensure the Event Display received the message sent to it by the Event Source.

   ```
   $ kubectl logs event-display-00001-deployment-5d5df6c7-gv2j4 -c user-container
