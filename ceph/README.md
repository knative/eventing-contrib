# Ceph to Knative Receive Adapters

The following receive adapters convert bucket notifications from [Ceph format](https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/notifications/#events) into CloudEvents format, and inject them into Knative.
Adapter logic follow the one described for [AWS S3](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/adapters/aws-s3.md) bucket notifications.

There are 4 different transport options:

## HTTP

This receive adapter expects bucket notifications from Ceph over HTTP transport, as payload in POST messages.
> Note that this adapted does not assume the CloudEvents HTTP binding in the incoming messages.

### Testing

- Create a namespace for the tests:

```
kubectl apply -f samples/ceph-eventing-ns.yaml
```

- Deploy a service for the bucket notification messages coming from Ceph:

```
kubectl apply -f samples/ceph-bucket-notification-svc.yaml -n ceph-eventing
```

- Deploy the ceph-event-display Knative service together with a channel and subscribe it to the channel:

```
ko apply -f samples/ceph-display-resources.yaml -n ceph-eventing
```

- Build and deploy the Ceph container source:

```
ko apply -f samples/ceph-container-source.yaml -n ceph-eventing
```

- Deploy a test pod that has cURL installed and a JSON file with bucket notifications (names `records.json`):

```
kubectl apply -f samples/test-pod.yaml -n ceph-eventing
```

- Execute cURL command on the test pod to send the JSON bucket notifications to the ceph-bucket-notifications service:

```
kubectl exec test -n ceph-eventing -- curl -d "@records.json" -X POST ceph-bucket-notifications.ceph-eventing.svc.cluster.local
```

- To verify that the events reached the ceph-event-display service, call:

```
kubectl logs -l serving.knative.dev/service=ceph-event-display -n ceph-eventing -c user-container --tail=100
```

## PubSub (TODO)

This receive adapter is pulling bucket notifications from a special "pubsub" zone in Ceph, and acking them once they are successfully sent to Knative.
More information about this mechanism could be found [here](https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/pubsub-module/).
> Note that this adapter needs access to the Ceph cluster to pull the notifications and ack them.

## AMQP0.9.1 (TODO)

This receive adapter is subscribed to a list of AMQP topics, on which bucket notifications are expected.
> Note that this adapted does not assume the CloudEvents AMQP binding in the incoming messages.

## Kafka (TODO)

This receive adapter is subscribed to a list of Kafka topics, on which bucket notifications are expected.
> Note that this adapted does not assume the CloudEvents Kafka binding in the incoming messages.
